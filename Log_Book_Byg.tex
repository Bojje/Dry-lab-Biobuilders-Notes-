\textbf{Talk with DTU Byg:}
\textbf{Update on DTU byg:}
they've shown me the machines we can use and I've gotten the name of the guy who can help us. The problem is that he is gone tomorrow and will first be back week 32, he says that we can only use the machine if we get help from him. They want us to create approximately 10 initial samples, so we can screw up while still having an ok statistics.

There are no dimension requirements, but if we want to make panels we should probably make them beam like so we can measure deflection when put under a strain (I imagine a panel at an angle put under strain from the winds on Mars). 

\textbf{Actions:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Made contact with Christian Peter Rasmussen, who will help us do the measurements
    \item Machines were made from Instron
    \item Get foam like material as baseline, maybe we can use it to test stuff (talk with Holger Koss if we want foam)
\end{enumerate}
