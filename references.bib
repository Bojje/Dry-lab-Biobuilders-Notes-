  abstract={We illustrate how to extract correlations between magnetic moments in assemblies of nanoparticles from, e.g., electron holography data providing the combined knowledge of particle size distribution, inter-particle distances, and magnitude and orientation of each magnetic moment within a nanoparticle superstructure, We show, based on simulated data, how to build a radial/angular pair distribution function f ( r , θ ) encoding the spatial and angular difference between every pair of magnetic moments. A scatter-plot of f ( r , θ ) reveals the degree of structural and magnetic order present, and hence provides a measure of the strength and range of magnetic correlations.}

Starting from well-known basic concepts, and drawing on examples from biology and biomedicine, the relevant physics of magnetic materials and their responses to applied magnetic fields are surveyed. The way these properties are controlled and used is illustrated with reference to (i) magnetic separation of labelled cells and other biological entities; (ii) therapeutic drug, gene and radionuclide delivery; (iii) radio frequency methods for the catabolism of tumours via hyperthermia; and (iv) contrast enhancement agents for magnetic resonance imaging applications. Future prospects are also discussed.}

This paper studies the problem of rigid-body simulation when the bodies being simulated are restricted to contact at only finitely many points. Some theoretical and practical issues in computing contact forces for systems with large numbers of contact points are considered. Both systems of rigid bodies with and without Coulomb friction are studied. Complexity results are derived for certain classes of configurations and numerical methods for computing contact forces are discussed.",

abstract="We report a structural study of magnetic colloids composed of CoFe2O4 nanoparticles (mean radii in the range 2--7 nm) synthesized by thermal decomposition of different high boiling temperature organic solvents in the presence of oleic acid and oleylamine, and subsequently re-suspended in hexane. Although the surfactant layer prevents permanent aggregation and precipitation of the disperse phase, competition between attractive interactions (i.e., dipolar and van der Waals) and repulsive steric interaction leads to self organization of the magnetic nanoparticles. Our small angle X-ray scattering results evidence the presence of distinctive self organized structures in the liquid colloid depending on the type of solvent used in the synthesis. A completely homogeneous dispersion is obtained for those colloids synthesized with benzyl-ether and octadecene. Bi-disperse systems, in which nanoclusters coexist with free nanoparticles, appear when phenyl-ether and trioctylamine are used. Chain-like structures are observed in a colloid containing the particles synthesized using phenyl-ether, while more compact 3D structures form in colloids prepared with particles synthesized with trioctylamine. The presented results have important implications in the design and selection of magnetic nanoparticles for those applications where the size dispersion determines the final efficiency of the material, such as magnetic fluid hyperthermia clinical therapy.",
